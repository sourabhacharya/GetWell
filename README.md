Project descriptionThe name of our Android app is GetWell. The overall objective of this application is to track the medication use habits of patients, and to utilize this data to improve healthcare services. This data can be utilized by the prescribing doctor to identify at-risk patients and as a reference for adjusting a patient’s pharmacotherapy intervention program. This data can additionally be utilized by insurance companies to track the pharmacotherapy compliance of the insuree, and to provide incentives based on their compliance to the intervention regimen. 

The initial scope of development will apply to the use case of prescribed opioids as a pharmacotherapy intervention for pain management, and the scope with then broaden to more diverse use cases within pharmacotherapy at large. It is also possible to eventually incorporate additional features in later iterations that would allow a patient to track their diet and activities in a manner similar to existing health management applications. This would provide a more advanced understanding of changes in a patient’s health. The development of this application should aspire to naturally augment the user’s daily routine without requiring impeding efforts from the user. 

This application intends to provide services to the following user populations:
●	Patients
●	Physicians
●	Pharmacies
